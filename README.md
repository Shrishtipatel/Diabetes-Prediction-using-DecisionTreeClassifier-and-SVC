# Diabetes-Prediction-using-DecisionTreeClassifier-and-SVC
Diabetes prediction using DecisionTreeClassifier and SVC (Support Vector Classifier) involves utilizing machine learning algorithms to analyze medical data and predict whether an individual is likely to have diabetes or not.
In the case of diabetes prediction, the decision tree algorithm would split the data based on features such as glucose levels, BMI, age, etc., to create a tree-like structure of decisions.
In diabetes prediction, SVC would try to find the best hyperplane to separate individuals with diabetes from those without, based on features like glucose levels, insulin, BMI, etc.
